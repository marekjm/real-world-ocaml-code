# Code for "Real World OCaml"

This repository contains code I wrote while going through the [Real World OCaml](https://realworldocaml.org/) book.
Some of it was just rewritten from the book, some I wrote myself.

### Incompatibilities with newer versions of OCaml or Core

In cases where the OCaml or Core library changed since the book was published I updated the code.
Suitable comments are embedded in changed files.
